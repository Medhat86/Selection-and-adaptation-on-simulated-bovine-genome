# Selection-and-adaptation-on-simulated-bovine-genome

This repository houses code and data (simulated bovine genome) to identify selection on quantitative traits. In this repository, we have divided files into subdirectories as outlined below. For analyses performed using GWDG Scientific Compute Cluster, we have deposited both bash files and outputs.
